## Overview of the Analysis

The puprose for this analysis was to train and evaluate a machine learning model to detect loan health and if they were healthy or high-risk.

The data consisted of values identifying loan size, interest rate, income of the borrower, number of accounts and any derogatory marks.

The stages of machine learning process involves reading in the data and separating it into labels and features, training the model with LogisticRregression, doing predictions, and lastly evaluating the model based on the confusion matrix and classification report.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * LogisticRegression
    * 99% Accuracy
    * Healthy: 100% Precision and 99% Recall
    * High-Risk: 84% Precision and 94%% Recall

## Summary

The LogisticRegression model performed very well in predicting Healthy and High-Risk loans with very high accuracy and precision.
